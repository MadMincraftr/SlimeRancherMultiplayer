# Slime Rancher Multiplayer Mod (PinkTarr fork)

This mod for slime rancher adds multiplayer to the game. as of build 160, the mod is bugged and is not for regular play.


Currently not being worked on until \[\[\[UNKNOWN\]\]\]

Dont worry, im not abandoning the project, i just need a break. 650 builds in 28 days. thats pressing Ctrl B 20+ times a day. Not to mention, i havent worked that hard on the project until 14 days ago. Since then, ive been constantly working on the project 6 hours a day. i need a break.
